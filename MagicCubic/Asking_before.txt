Now let's add some rule to play Rubic's cube.
1.The initial mode is the cube-rotation mode.
2.In cube-rotation mode, if the left click button of the mouse is pressed down while the mouse is moving, then make the cube rotate according to the movement of the mouse.
3.When a center of the cube's side is clicked, terminate cube-rotation mode and activate side-rotation mode.
4.In side-rotation mode, press left-click to do a 90 degrees left-rotation; otherwise, right-click to do a 90 degrees right-rotation. Press "esc" to return to cube-rotation mode.
