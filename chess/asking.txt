Good job!
Now, let's make this to be a online chess game.
This game can be play by the two computers which is connect by the above server-client program.

I run the program, and the client can connect to server.
But when I move the chess, it shoe this message"expected uci string to be of length 4 or 5: 'Hello from client'"
And the client terminal doesn't show the game

Please set the UCI format coordinate numbers suround the checkerboard.
Don't change other thing.

Nice!
Then, let's change the way of playing this chess game.
Use mouse to select a piece to move intead of using UCI format.
And mad the ui interface like the picture which I give to you, especial the checkerboard.

List the images that I need to build.
Do I need to made the client have same pictures?

Ok, I finish create the pictures.
I called them whiteking.png, whitequeen.png...
Please help me fix the program about the name of images.
