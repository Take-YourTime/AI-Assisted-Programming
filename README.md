# AI-Assisted-Programming
These files are in-class projects and homework of a course - "AI-Assisted Programming".
  
The main target of this course is to make a big project with supporting of LLM,   
whether you are familiar with the specific coding language.  
So, how to ask LLM in a proper way is pretty important, which is called **"prompt engineering"**.  
  
The projects' construct are made with ChatGPT 4o by using prompt engineering.  
After most of the project is done, the programmer adjust the output detail to finish the project.  
  
Therefore, **programmers do not need to write much code;  
we only need to read and understand the logic output by the LLM**.
