Use python code to create 5 random playing cards image.
Cards are at the top of image and there is a blank amount them.
Use the unicode to create the symbol.
Show the image.

Good job! Some problems.
The carreaux and the coeurs cards should be red.
Only the cards paper is white, the background is black.

The code can't run.
'ImageDraw' object has no attribute 'textsize'

Good job!
Make the card number on the top left of the card, and make the symbol on the top right of the card.
Let the height of picture be higher. 


Good job!
Now, let's make this become a poker game.
Each card has its index, from left to right is: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5.
Then the program will ask player "What do you want to discard?".
Player will input some number, such as "1, 2, 4", then the first card, the second card and the fourth card shuld be replaced by new cards.
Each time, after discarding cards, produce a new image and show accroading to current five cards.
Note that, the player shouldn't get repeated card at anytime!!!

After ask player "What do you want to discard?" or player input "none", output the result of cards.
The result may be "Straight flush", "Four of a kind", "Full house", "Three of a kind", "Straight", "Flush", "Two pair", "Two of a kind", or "Nothing". The result is recroading to the last five cards.

After print the output, repeat the game by give player new five cards, you can use "While 1: pass".


Now, I want you to act as a python REPL, and run this python program.
If the program has output, just output it.
If the program create a picture, then give me a link to download the picture or just show the picture.
If the program need input, ask me to input.
