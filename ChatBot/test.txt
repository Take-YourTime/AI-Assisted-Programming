Let a = 2 + 3
Let b = 2 * a
Let c = 3 * b
What is the number of a ?
What is the number of b ?
What is the number of c ?
Please answer question 1.


I will give you a question, please split it into three part. Then I will ask you to handle which part.
E.g. 1*1 + 2*2 + 3*3 = ? First part is 1*1, second part is 2*2, second part is 3*3. The final answer is part1 + part2 + part3.

What is the answer of 2 * 2 + 3 * 2 + 3 * 1?
Split this question into three parts, and answer the first part.
Make sure that, it shoud do multiple first then do plus or minus.
